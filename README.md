Analysis of expenditures data from the Missouri Department of Corrections

All files used in this analysis was downloaded from the Missouri Accountability Portal: https://mapyourtaxes.mo.gov/MAP/Portal/Default.aspx

Data had to be downloaded by each individual fiscal year, and combined into a master-file in R. I analyzed expenditures of the Department of Corrections, with special focus on vendors paid for medical and dental services.
